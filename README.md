## Basics
This program allows a user to create a QR code for a url or text, with the user's own image as a logo in the middle.

The image for the logo needs to be saved in the project folder. This program supports PNG and JPG formats but not SVG, RAW, HEIC, etc.

The QRCode can point to a url or display text.

**WARNING: Make sure to pre-install Pillow and qrcode libraries in your virtual env for this project and definitely not generally or else it can create conflicts.**

## Pillow module 

Replaces Python Image Library and is used to open the image for the qr code. Use PIL to call it. Documentation: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html.
